The application will provide the daily data about chosen currencies and will enable analysis of this data including dependencies between crypto currency and factors like: GPU prices, COVID pandemic and another important situations in the last 10-15 years.  

## What the project consists of at the moment?
Currently we're working with deploying logic related with storing data about users and user authentication. For now, we've build very simple InMemoryUserRepository, in which we are storing data about users. We can simply test functionalities of our platform in the Postman. Ultimately, we are planning to build SQL database in PostgreSQL.

## Basic functionalities
Along with creation new functionalities of our platform, we are going to describe them in a very transparent way, so every user could simply understand how this exactly works.
